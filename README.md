# Harvard-ATG .github repo

This is a special repo that does things to how github repositories function across this organization account. Currently it does two different things:

## Organization profile

The `README.md` file in the `profile` folder appears on the [Harvard-ATG Github org profile](https://github.com/Harvard-ATG) page.

## Pull Request Template

The `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` file provides an initial template for new pull requests. This is not intended as a mandate to fill out, but rather a reminder of what we've already agreed are helpful guidelines.
